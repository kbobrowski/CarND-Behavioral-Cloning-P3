# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Self-driving car using end-to-end deep learning - steering angle is controlled only by the front camera video stream. Part of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree.

# Implementation

Convolutional neural network was implemented in Keras, and model was trained on about 45000 images. For more details see the [script](model.py) and the [report](writeup_report.md)

# Videos

The first video demonstrates two laps around the track driven autonomously in the forward and opposite direction:
